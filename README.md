# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Visualization with Python

This project visualizes weather data such as daily **high and low temperatures** and **precipitation** for different locations using Python and Matplotlib. It's inspired by exercises from *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes and extended with a dataset for Mumbai.

## üìä Visualizations

Each Jupyter Notebook generates a line chart showing:
- **Death Valley, USA (2018)**: Daily high and low temperatures.
- **Sitka, Alaska (2018)**: Daily high and low temperatures.
- **Mumbai, India**: Daily precipitation levels (rainfall).

Charts include:
- Temperature/precipitation over time
- Color-coded highs, lows, and precipitation
- Shaded area between highs and lows
- Proper date formatting and labeling
